Todo:

- Photoshop the background of the website.
- Create page for other members of the livestream team.
- Add Hal's text:
    My name is Hal. I'm the Producer,
    Coordinator, and general Brain-Trust (haha) of the Level One Show.
    I first came up with the idea for the show during a sick day in
    March of 2014. I was heavily influenced by thejarren's "Tux Show"
    he hosted over the fall of 2013. Instead of just focusing on
    interviewing everyone's favorite YouTuber, I decided I wanted to
    go deeper in the Gaming community. I was lucky enough for Mak Sok,
    the CTO of the website player.me to be our first guest ever on the
    show. Lately, I've been coming up with more ideas to make the
    Level One Show brand more diverse, like Charity Livestreams, and
    our own Stream Team. If you have any ideas or questions, feel free
    to tweet at me!
