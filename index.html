              <p class="sub_paragraph">My name is Hal. I'm the Producer,
              Coordinator, and general Brain-Trust of the Level One Show.
              I first came up with the idea for the show during a sick day in
              March of 2014. I was inspired by thejarren's "Tux Show",
              hosted in 2013. Instead of focusing on interviewing famous
              YouTubers, I wanted to go deeper in the Gaming community. Lately,
              I've been coming up with more ideas to make the Level One Show brand
              more diverse, like Charity Livestreams. If you have any ideas or
              questions, feel free to tweet at me!</p>

              <p class="sub_paragraph">Yo, what is up guys, my name is Nick, but
              you might know me better as KuangSteak. When Hal approached me
              with the idea of the Level One Show, I was super into the concept
              and I gladly agreed to help him start the show. I provided the
              original art for the stream and I co-commentated with Hal.
              When Hal approached me about expanding the brand, I decided I
              could help in more ways than just commentating. I brought up the
              idea of a website, and the rest of the crew perceived it very well.
              So, I set out to create it and it is what you see here now. However,
              I recently decided to take a more "backstage" role on the show and
              I will no longer be a host of the show after winter season one. If
              you have any questions, feel free to hit me up on twitter.</p>

            Everyone involved had a blast, and we hope you did too. In total
            people donated nearly $200 in the U.S. ALONE! Even if we were not
            able to see how much people donated from outside the U.S., we would
            like to thank you for your donations. Have a great winter and the
            Level One Show at the end of spring 2015.</p>
